      Alation is a metadata intelligence platform that allows businesses to harness the power of their metadata to realize value for every data and AI intiative.

      The Alation Metadata Catalog is an empty canvass until it is populated with metadata. I own the platform infrastructure and services that bring in metadata from customers' on-premsie and cloud databases into Alation. That encompasses several components:

      - Alation Agent; a suite of cloud services and an on-premise appliance customers install within their network boundray to bring in metadata into Alation's cloud without poking holes in their firewalls
      - Open Connector Framework; a framework that enables Alation and its partners to quickly build database connectors
      - Alation Connector Manager; a stack that orchestrates and manages the database connectors

#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a software engineer and technologist based out of the greater Boston area. My interests are broad and span distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, developer tooling, automation, secruity and database systems. I was born and raised in Jordan, and I spent all of my childhood and teenage years in Amman. In my free time, I enjoy reading, exploring new technology, playing soccer, and visting the best breweries in New England.
